## optical bench
Simulation of a lens on an optical bench made in Excel.

There are some Excel features used that are not supported within other spreadsheet environments. Also, some Excel features (e.g. controls) used in this simulation are not guarenteed to work on older versions of Excel.

This is one of a few simulations originally created in the Spring of 2020 while I was working as a physics instructor. The sudden switch to remote learning during the rapid spread of COVID-19 required changes in teaching physics labs. Without access to physical equipment, I considered rewriting labs to use items typically found at home. However, the topics for the rest of the semester included magnetism, light, and circuits; and it would be unlikely any of my students would have the necessary items to investigate those topics. So, I decided simulations could be the next best thing.

Many of the good simulations I knew about were no longer available because Flash was gone (R.I.P.). Other simulations I found were inadequate for my needs. There wasn't time to aquire a sufficient proficiency with HTML5 and Javascript to build new ones. In my search for something, anything, I came across http://www.engineers-excel.com/. Using this as an inspiration, I proceeded to build some simulations in a software environment my students were familiar with.
